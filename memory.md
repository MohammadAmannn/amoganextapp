# Memory Log - Dev Session Summary

This file summarizes the database fixes, map custom layouts, geocoding proxies, and realtime synchronization bugs resolved during today's session.

---

## 1. Leaflet Map Style Updates
* **CARTO Basemaps**: Configured `leaflet-map.tsx` to load **CARTO Positron** (light mode) and **CARTO Dark Matter** (dark mode) tiles dynamically based on the current application theme.
* **Layout Invalidation Fix**: Solved the map centering issue by invalidating map sizes after a `250ms` delay to allow transition animations to settle before loading tiles.
* **Controls & Popup Customization**:
  - Re-positioned map zoom in/out controls to the left side (`topleft` explicitly).
  - Aligned the map marker popup's close cross button (`x`) to the left of the popup bubble using custom CSS selectors.

## 2. Serverless Geocoding Proxy
* **Local Proxy Endpoint**: Created `/api/geocode/route.ts` to perform OSM Nominatim geocoding queries on the server side with custom user-agent headers.
* **CORS & Mobile Fix**: Solved the issue where mobile phones could not retrieve the place/area name (falling back to raw coordinates) due to CORS blocks.
* **Geocode Throttling**: Added a throttle filter inside `LocationPicker` to restrict geocoding queries to once every 5 seconds, preventing HTTP 429 rate limit blocks.

---

## 3. Realtime Messages Mappings
* **Realtime Parser**: Added `location_data` and `location_type` properties mapping within the Supabase subscription listener inside `use-realtime.ts`.
* **Sync Delay Fix**: Resolved the bug where location message bubbles appeared as empty placeholders until the user refreshed the page.

---

## 4. Layout & Chat bugs
* **Stale Message Ghosting**: Cleared the local message list state (`setMessages([])`) immediately when switching conversations in `chat-layout.tsx` to prevent stale message leakage.
* **Database compatibility**: Added the generated column `is_group` (derived from `type`) to the `conversations` table, resolving Postgres `column "is_group" does not exist` errors when marking messages as read.
* **Location Picker close cross button**: Moved the picker dialog close button to the top-left of the header panel inside `locationpicker.tsx`.
